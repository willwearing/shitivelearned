# Shit I've Learned:

1. The rule of 3
2. Compound interest is king (not just with money - relationships, reputation)
3. Don't be the smartest in the room = Work with the very best people you can - you'll learn and add way more
4. The secret to networking is hanging out with people you want to have a beer with
5. Treat areas of your life like silos - the more silos you have the 'fuller' they are - the easier it is to navigate a loss 
6. Money and low hanging fruit - treat your career like a business - higher turnover and lower costs = more profit, fire bad customers and reward great ones, loyalty and relationships matter - but only for so long, invest in yourself, moving (companies and geographies) can be the easiest way to get a LARGE pay rise, ask for a pay rise - you'll be surprised how often this works, 
7. Have a side hustle - the easiest way to learn an MBA and earn extra $ is to have a $0 or low upfront business 
8. Communication is everything - learn how to by door knocking and selling stuff door to door for 3 months (minimum)
9. Trust your gut
10. Spend time with 'the other side' and seek first to understand others before trying to make them understand you - you'll be surprised how much you agree on and how much you can work together on 
11. Age is just a number - results matter, age does not. 
12. Life is short - enjoy what you do, where you do it and who you do it with 
13. Time speeds up as you get older - pay attention to rule 12 
14. Consistency over short bursts will carry you much, much further - see rule 2
15. Learn something new every single day
16. When considering what to do with your life - get to $100k in the bank ASAP, invest, then work on 'the arts and culture' - it's generally a lot easier this way around 
17. Start with saving and investing a minimum of 10% of your income every pay cycle - see rule 2 
18. Tell the people you care about that you love em
19. Success comes from homeruns. How do you get a homerun? Keep swinging!!! To increase your odds - see rule 6
20. A monthly salary is a harmful addiction 
21. Surround yourself with the people you most want to be like - if you want to be financially successful and don't know anyone, you can use books/blogs/podcasts/Youtube
22. Have a northstar - have goals that matter to you - set them in the 7 areas of life - track them! 
23. What gets measured gets done - see rule 22
